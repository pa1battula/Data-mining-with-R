       "1 Super good, don't get me wrong. But I came for the caramel and brownies, not the sweet cream. The packaging made it seem like brownies were packed and bountiful *crying frowny emoji* I'd say the taste of this was amazing, but the ratio of brownie to sweet cream was disappointing. Liked it regardless but probably won't buy again simply because it didn't live up to its promising package. I'll find another one that has a better ratio and wayyy more yummy chewy brownies.\\nOverall, good flavor, texture, idea, and brownies. Not so great caramel/sweet cream/ brownie RATIO. Just add more brownies. Please.                                                                                                                 \n",
       "2 I decided to try it out although I\\342\\200\\231m not a huge caramel fan, and the first buy was ok, didn\\342\\200\\231t like the caramel too much and for some reason that specific pint barely had any brownies! Like there were some on top but from the middle to the bottom? Zilch. Nada. Nothing! It was disappointing. But for some reason, I bought it again and I really do believe it was just that point bcuz the second one was glorious!! I had a big brownie chunk in EVERY bite. Plus the caramel didn\\342\\200\\231t bother me as much and I took a liking to it. Conclusion: I\\342\\200\\231m on my fifth pint, of the week and I\\342\\200\\231m going back to get my daily pint cus I\\342\\200\\231m kinda sick and need some happiness.\n",
       "3 My caramel core begins to disappear about half way through. I only buy this for the caramel core. The first time I purchased this I was not even aware that there were blonde bits in there. You had me a salted caramel core, well this is the fourth pint that I have purchased and the caramel is plentiful at the top then it begins to get sparse about half way down at 3/4s of the way down its gone. It works out in my husbands favor because he doesn't care for the caramel so he gets to finish my pint while having a full pint of his choice. Please please please, its called salted caramel core for a reason. Let the caramel flow through the core. P.S. You could put a little extra in there, I totally would not mind.  \n",
       "4 Why are people complaining about the blonde brownies? If you don\\342\\200\\231t like blonde brownies, get ice cream with fudge brownies! I LOVE the blonde brownies and cannot get enough of them. This ice cream is by far my favorite. I have driven to multiple stores to try and find it... and when I do, I stock up! I\\342\\200\\231ve tried other flavors when I can\\342\\200\\231t find this one, and none of them even come close to making me as happy as this does! I\\342\\200\\231d say sometimes the caramel to brownie ratio is a little off at times (more brownies please!), but I\\342\\200\\231ll still always enjoy it nevertheless!                                                                                                 \n",
       "5 This ice cream is worst ice cream I\\342\\200\\231ve ever tasted. I was beyond excited when I picked it up today and couldn\\342\\200\\231t wait to get home and try it. First the sweet cream ice cream has no flavour. But that\\342\\200\\231s fine I could get past that, but the salted caramel core is what\\342\\200\\231s really wrong. It\\342\\200\\231s disgusting and so salty it\\342\\200\\231s actually inedible. I\\342\\200\\231ve had ice cream before that I have really enjoyed but never to the point where I physically can not stomach it. I love salted caramel but this is just another level. I actually came here to read the reviews and see how others thought of it just in case mine was a bad batch. Never again!                 \n",
       "6 I bought this last night to go with Louisiana Crunch cake because I was craving that salty and sweet flavor. Unfortunately, I was not thrilled with the salted caramel core of this ice cream. Usually, when you have salted caramel, the salt enhances the flavor of the caramel. The salt in this core OVERWHELMED everything, even the cake. It was disappointing to not enjoy my dessert and I doubt I'll be finishing this pint of ice cream, which is a shame because you should never have to throw away ice cream.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
